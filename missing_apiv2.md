# Missing APIs for Tweet Analysis Platform

## Authentication
- The current API documentation assumes JWT authentication, but the actual implementation uses OTP. Need API endpoints for sending OTP and verifying OTP codes.

## Real-time Feedback
- The provided API doesn't have websocket connections documented for real-time search progress updates. We'll need to simulate this with polling.

## Search API Structure
- The current search implementation needs to be adjusted to follow the 3-phase approach (collection, analysis, report).

## Additional Requirements
- Need to implement client-side caching to improve performance and reduce API calls.
- Need to handle the transition between search phases smoothly in the UI.
- Need to handle errors and retry mechanisms in case of network issues.
